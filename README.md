Heart attack is a myocardial necrosis caused by acute and persistent ischemia and hypoxia of coronary artery which manifestations are arrhythmia, shock or heart failure, which can be fatal. A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked. The blockage is most often a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). Sometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow.

### Dataset Information:
The dataset consists of 303 rows and 14 columns with label Output. Data contains all numerical data.

### Refered from kaggle:
#### https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset

### Problem Statement:
Predict the Heart Attack based on the features provided.

### Project Contents:
0.Data Dictionary

1.Import Librares  

2.Load the data from given csv file into dataframe  

3.Basic Operation of dataset

4.Cleaning the dataset 

5.Explotary data analysis   

6.Data Visualization

7.Machine Learning Model    

8.Conclusion

### Approach:
The Aim to create model that help the user to apply machine learning approach to predict the satisfication level.Here the model used are

1.Support Vector Machine

2.Logistic Regression

3.Gaussian Naive Bayes  

4.Naive Bayes Classifier for Multivariante Bernoulli Model 

5Random Forest Classifier

6.Kneighbors Classifier  

7.Gradient Boosting for Classification

### Conclusion:
In general, the models have good predictive values. The best guess among them is the BernoulliNB model, as it seems.
